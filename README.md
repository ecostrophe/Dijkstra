# Dijkstra
An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between to vertex
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between a and b.
It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance, 
calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor,
and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller.
